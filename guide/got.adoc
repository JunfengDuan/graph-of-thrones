=== Analyzing Text

Most of this demo is based on work done by Dr. Andrew Beveridge, based on his "Network of Thrones" research:

=== Graph of Character Interactions

//image::http://www.lyonwj.com/public/img/got-graph-full.png[float=right]

Build a graph where each character is a node and the relationships represent character interactions.

RETURN p

== Analyzing The Network

=== Number of characters

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (c:Character) RETURN count(c)
----

=== Summary statistics

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (c:Character)-[:INTERACTS]->()
WITH c, count(*) AS num
RETURN min(num) AS min, max(num) AS max, avg(num) AS avg_characters, stdev(num) AS stdev
----

=== Diameter of the network

The diameter (or geodesic) of a network is defined as the longest shortest path in the network.

[source,cypher]
----
// Find maximum diameter of network
// maximum shortest path between two nodes
MATCH (a:Character), (b:Character) WHERE id(a) > id(b)
MATCH p=shortestPath((a)-[:INTERACTS*]-(b))
RETURN length(p) AS len, extract(x IN nodes(p) | x.name) AS path
ORDER BY len DESC LIMIT 4
----

== Shortest Path

We can use the shortestPath function in Cypher to find the shortest path between any two characters in the graph. Let’s find the shortest path from Catelyn Stark to Kahl Drogo:

[source,cypher]
----
// Shortest path from Catelyn Stark to Khal Drogo
MATCH (catelyn:Character {name: "Catelyn"}), (drogo:Character {name: "Drogo"})
MATCH p=shortestPath((catelyn)-[INTERACTS*]-(drogo))
RETURN p
----

=== All shortest paths

There might be other paths of the same length connecting Catelyn and Drogo. We can find these with the allShortestPaths Cypher function:

[source,cypher]
----
// All shortest paths from Catelyn Stark to Khal Drogo
MATCH (catelyn:Character {name: "Catelyn"}), (drogo:Character {name: "Drogo"})
MATCH p=allShortestPaths((catelyn)-[INTERACTS*]-(drogo))
RETURN p
----


== Pivotal Nodes

A node is said to be pivotal if it lies on all shortest paths between two other nodes in the network. We can find all pivotal nodes in the network.

.Source: https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/networks-book/[Networks, Crowds, Markets]

[source,cypher]
----
// Find all pivotal nodes in network
MATCH (a:Character), (b:Character)
MATCH p=allShortestPaths((a)-[:INTERACTS*]-(b)) WITH collect(p) AS paths, a, b
MATCH (c:Character) WHERE all(x IN paths WHERE c IN nodes(x)) AND NOT c IN [a,b]
RETURN a.name, b.name, c.name AS PivotalNode SKIP 490 LIMIT 10
----


[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (a:Character {name: "Drogo"}), (b:Character {name: "Ramsay"})
MATCH p=allShortestPaths((a)-[:INTERACTS*]-(b))
RETURN p

== Centrality measures

In graph theory and network analysis, indicators of centrality identify the most important vertices within a graph. Applications include identifying the most influential person(s) in a social network, key infrastructure nodes in the Internet or urban networks, and super-spreaders of disease.

=== Degree Centrality

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (c:Character)
RETURN c.name AS character, size( (c)-[:INTERACTS]-() ) AS degree ORDER BY degree DESC
----

=== Weighted Degree Centrality

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (c:Character)-[r:INTERACTS]-()
RETURN c.name AS character, sum(r.weight) AS weightedDegree ORDER BY weightedDegree DESC
----

== Apoc Procedures

== Betweenness Centrality

The betweenness centrality of a node in a network is the number of shortest paths between two other members in the network on which a given node appears.

Betweenness centality is an important metric because it can be used to identify “brokers of information” in the network or nodes that connect disparate clusters.

image::http://www.lyonwj.com/public/img/betweenness-centrality.png[]

.The red nodes have a high betweenness centrality and are connectors of clusters.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (c:Character)
WITH collect(c) AS characters
CALL apoc.algo.betweenness(['INTERACTS'], characters, 'BOTH') YIELD node, score
SET node.betweenness = score
RETURN node.name AS name, score ORDER BY score DESC
----

== Closeness Centrality

Nodes with high closeness centality are often highly connected within clusters in the graph, but not necessarily highly connected outside of the cluster.

Closeness centrality is the inverse of the average distance to all other characters in the network.

image::http://www.lyonwj.com/public/img/closeness-centrality.png[]

.Nodes with high closeness centrality are connected to many other nodes in a network.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (c:Character)
WITH collect(c) AS characters
CALL apoc.algo.closeness(['INTERACTS'], characters, 'BOTH') YIELD node, score
RETURN node.name AS name, score ORDER BY score DESC
----

== Using python igraph

We can use Neo4j with Python data science tools as well...
